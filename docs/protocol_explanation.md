nucleotides are base 4 numbers. here is what the default protocol should 
look like:

0 -> A
1 -> T
2 -> C
3 -> G

this can be extended to any number of base 4^n. here is what the default 
protocol for a base 16 number should look like:

0 -> AA
1 -> AT
2 -> AC
3 -> AG
4 -> TA
5 -> TT
6 -> TC
7 -> TG
8 -> CA
9 -> CT
a -> CC
b -> CG
c -> GA
d -> GT
e -> GC
f -> GH
